This file outlines changes to the package, in reverse chronological order.

0.8.2
=====

24 April 2011

- Bug fix: when unjumbling a texture pack, don’t change its label and
  description to ‘unjumbled’.

0.8.1
=====

12 April 2011

- Bug fix: composite images using palletized source images had ugly
  results because the replaced times would be force-mapped on to the
  base image’s colour pallet. Images are now uplifted to RGBA format to
  prevent this.

0.8
===

8 April 2011

- `MapBase.get_css` expresses a tile from a texture as CSS styles.

0.7
===

4 April 2011

- `Loader.add_local_knowledge` allows you to use a local copy of HTTP
  resources (should be useful on the web site that happens to implement
  those resources)

0.6.3 (Head cold special)
========================

3 April 2011


- `Map.get_alt_list` allows `stone1` as well as `stone_1`, but knows
  that `crop0`, ..., `crop7` are not alternative versions of a
  nonexistent texture `crop`.

- Bug fix: using a string to fetch an atlas resulted in an infinite
  loop! Now the string is instead treated as a URL

0.6

2 April 2011

- Feature: map method `Map.get_alt_list` gets a list of candiates for
  making an alternative-textures remix of a pack.

0.5.1
=====

10 March 2011

- Bug fix: Setting a cache directory with `set_http_cache` should now work!

0.5
====

10 March 2011

- New recipe keywords `unjumble` and `if_missing` to work with ZIPs containing files with
  the correct names but in the wrong folders.

0.4.1
=====

9 March 2011

- Bug fix: LazyPack returned wrong value for last-modified. Missing test :-(

0.4
===

9 March 2011

- New recipe keyword: `pack_icon`: create a `pack.png` from the terrain file.

- Add `get_last_modified` and `is_modified_since` methods to resources and
  packs.

- Hence make the `maketexture` script avoid rebuilding packs if their
  ingredients are unmodified.

  as base URL per <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>.

- Loader has `add_scheme` method so you can hook in to internal recipe
  database by defining custom URL schemes.

- Recipes can declare formal pack parameters which must be filled in to
  make the recipe.

- Labels and description in recipes can depend on labels and
